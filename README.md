# Wavetables-2024

This repository contains several sets of wavetables created during 2024. Most wavetables are banks of 64 tables (or waves) made of 256 frames (or samples) each. The number of tables may vary between 2 to 64 depending on the bank created. The highest resolutions used for the tables is 2048 frames to be compatible with Vital or Vitalium. Other sound systems (such as "The Grid" in Bitwig Studio) automatically process the number of tables and frames in the banks and facilitate the use for production of electronic music. Overall, these banks have been tested with a limited number of synthetizers and other musical software, and hence, unforeseen software behaviors may occur.

An example of music produced with the wavetables in this repository is provided by the file `Sample-Music.mp3`.
